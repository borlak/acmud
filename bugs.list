[ ] logs player in as default creature, when they quit, adds default creature to player
    table.  got a screencap of logs that initiated this saved under defcrit.bug in /src
    possibly related to when new characters login/save.
[ ] writing a note...typed delete, got "deleted -1 from db" .. saw delete function
    doesn't have notes in it.. tried 'note remove #' and it crashed mud
[b] taking stuff from bags not working... (get all bag still doesn't work)
--- bugs above this line found after 11/17/2007
[ ] what's this silly cmdio.c file??!! combine it
[ ] get rid of redundant string functions! I like pip's name better.. findinset
[ ] make mud do a reset at startup
[ ] deleting a reset caused crash
[ ] resets don't show that you are editing them? i.e. pip edits shop[0]?
[ ] resets use check_builder but don't have a check for resets?
[b] wierd descriptor bug when rebooting while two instances of the mud are up 
    (ie.builder/test port).. it will usurp players from the other mud
    -- pip try and reproduce this, doesn't seem to work anymore

// FIXED
[B] duplicate equipment bug - logging in and out dupes worn/inventory?!? 
    when did this happen?
// SINCE 11/17/2007
[PB] you can't @delete 1
[B] using @before and putting in ansi doesn't work.. shows the actual "MUD" ansi codes
    -- can't duplicate ?
[B] user/socket and hostnames aren't done quite right yet
[B] some bug with hotrebooting and kicking you off -- descriptors aren't loaded right?
[BP] edit room__# <-- the extra space between room and number crashes it
    -- couldn't reproduce.. must have been fixed with my last command overhaul
// since the 3-18-2005 release
[B] dude's corpse and dude in same room.. can tickle corpse, but tickle 2 dude won't
    tickle the player.. this is because it goes thru find_obj and then find_player but
    is looking for a second player named dude -- need to add up every obj/crit found..
    and lets redo the way we count stuff, im not sure i like the way i did it!
[P] @replace at end of sentence wont work.. and make it so it can replace multiple
    words. (also made it so it doesn't loop continuosly trying to replace a word that
    contains the same word  i.e. replacing h with hi)
[B] not allowing negative numbers in macros.h ??
[P] line paging kicking some people off - inulis gets kicked when he hits enter after
    24 line page pause.. when it's set to -1, nothing happens.
    -- this had to do with socket code not accepting "enter-only" input (i.e. ppl that
    hit enter key) on clients that only send \n -... oops!
[P] fix problem with java applet, will hang if you hit enter with no input.
    -- was doing if recvlen <= 0 which got telnet defaults because they do \r\n
    but was infinitely looping for java because it only sends \n
[P] still crashing on forcing ld to do stuff with sockets.. i.e. force bor tit .
    -- that's because we were NULLing the sockets out, and using flags instead of
    connection status on linkdead.  moved everything to CON_LINKDEAD
[B] system is losing time?? i had it set to nuclear time and i checked later and it's
    5-6 minutes off.
    -- thats like a linux or box prob so who cares
[B] notes will show up in list instantly even before editing is complete.
    -- now shows if someone is editing a note
[B] kicked for spamming out of editor... how to handle. (doesn't save currently)
    -- can't be kicked for spamming while in editor now
[P] some clients (putty is a known one) will come up with invalid name for the first
    attempt, but work after that... they must send extra characters the first time?
    -- discovered this is a putty issue, the first time it connects everywhere instead
    of the first letter it does some wierd stuff, here's a log for the name pip: [LOG] ARG: û û'ûip
    does this on a number of different muds and mud bases.
[B] in coin_string function, seems to hold "strings" in memory 
    as well as the worth. i.e. if you call it twice it keeps the same
    "worth" value and uses it again for the next function.
    -- this problem is with sprintf and static chars.. work around it.
[P] idle crash bug from jb/crys - this one was horrible, 6 month bug having to do
    with the way we read sockets.. thanks to RobSeace, i3839, and Uzume on the Unix
    Socket FAQ for helping me walk through our socket code.
    the bug - http://www.developerweb.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=748&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0

[P] @after #(no other input) .. crashes it.
[P] You say 'you should allow spaces at the beginning of a string in editor'
[P] make prompt have more options and make options work: %r (room number) %R (room desc) etc.
    -- already had this functionality, but borlak didn't use all_args
[B] tar in database backup doesn't like .. in "member" names. use a variable for their directory?
[B] fix time so it creates a new record each boot up
[P] fix telnet so it works with windows telnet and zMud
[P] allow two word keywords in help?
[P] fix create_host: bind: address already in use
[P] on convert... sometimes crashes on update_resets on door resets because of invalid rooms
[B] if (editing) then cancel if link dropped.
[B] what flags do mobs have when created? all of them? i notice you remove player flag..
    -- i remove player flag because of memory recycling, silly!
[P] fix wear code to allow for 2 spots with the same name, ie "held held" or "finger finger".. you can hold 2 things
[B] backups mysteriously stopped working!
[B] fix the bug with players not saving.
[P] fix page line pausing (first time doesn't pause and reprompts for every enter pushed)
[B] give a cpl more tries to reconnect attempts b4 making them wait
[P] check randneg, don't think it's working right!
[P] crash on .$n $N $s $S $x $X borlak
[B] edit object, edit <etc> should all work
[B] check into making trans work with coins (combining etc) <-- nah, implemented Combine command
