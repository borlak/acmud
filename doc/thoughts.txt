                             Thoughts for A C Mud

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This document contains ideas that you may want to implement, but we did not.

*  Limited amounts of shop items.  You could use resets to control how often
   shopkeepers have items... or you could do something unique for shops.
   Currently shops have unlimited numbers of items.  Also, you can do the 
   same thing for storage space for storage shops.  Limit the max weight a
   storage spot can contain.

*  You may also want to consider the possibility of player-owned shops.  
   This could be done so anyone could walk up to someone and list their
   wares, without bothering the player directly.  Also another idea on the
   same line would be player owned shops that mobs can run.  You have the
   same basic setup, with a variable owner on the shop struct also.  Also
   a variable that keeps track of how much profit is made by the store.  
   Then a player can walk into their store and "collect" the profits.  Good 
   for roleplay, etc.  The list/buy/sell commands can be tweaked fairly 
   easily to allow these possibilities.

*  Another thing to do with our bank/storage shops:  You could base cost on
   weight of object * days in storage.  More real.  We are only going to 
   charge a one-time fee upon the original storage.

*  Shops already have an interest variable -- you may want banks to charge
   interest when player's withdraw money.  At 10% interest, when someone 
   withdraws 50 copper, they get charged an additional 5.
